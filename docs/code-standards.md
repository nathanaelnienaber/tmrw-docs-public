Hereâ€™s a list of **code standards best practices** you can add to your documentation. These practices help maintain a consistent and clean codebase, making it easier to collaborate, debug, and scale.

---

### **1. General Code Standards**
1. **Consistency**
   - Follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., `snake_case`, `camelCase`, `PascalCase`) across files, variables, functions, and classes.
   - Use consistent indentation (e.g., 2 or 4 spaces; avoid mixing tabs and spaces).

2. **Documentation**
   - Add meaningful comments for complex logic.
   - Use a standardized documentation style (e.g., JSDoc, Doxygen, or Python docstrings).
   - Include a `README.md` for high-level project overview and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution guidelines.

3. **Error Handling**
   - Handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
   - Avoid swallowing errors; log them where appropriate.

4. **Code Reviews**
   - All code must go through peer reviews via pull requests.
   - Use checklists for code reviews to ensure adherence to standards.

### **2. Language-Specific Best Practices**
Add language-specific guidelines based on your stack. For example:

#### **For Python**
- Use `PEP 8` as the standard style guide.
- Type hint all function arguments and return types:
  ```python
  def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
      return a + b
  ```
- Keep functions small and focused (Single Responsibility Principle).

#### **For JavaScript/TypeScript**
- Use `ESLint` with a shared configuration for consistent code quality.
- Always use `const` and `let` instead of `var`.
- Prefer `async/await` over `then` for promises.

#### **For Go**
- Follow `Effective Go` guidelines.
- Name packages clearly and concisely.
- Use the built-in `go fmt` tool for consistent formatting.

### **3. Naming Conventions**
1. **File and Folder Naming**
   - Use lowercase for files and directories (`user_service.js`).
   - Separate words with underscores or hyphens (`user-service.js`).

2. **Variable and Function Names**
   - Use descriptive names (`total_users` instead of `x`).
   - Follow project conventions:
     - `snake_case` for variables and functions.
     - `PascalCase` for classes and constructors.

3. **Constants**
   - Use `ALL_CAPS` with underscores for constants:
     ```javascript
     const MAX_RETRIES = 5;
     ```

### **4. Git Practices**
1. **Branch Naming**
   - Use prefixes for branches:
     - `feat/feature-name` for new features.
     - `fix/issue-name` for bug fixes.
     - `docs/document-name` for documentation changes.

2. **Commit Messages**
   - Use the conventional format:
     ```
     [type]: [short summary]

     [optional body with more details]
     ```
   - Types include:
     - `feat`: A new feature.
     - `fix`: A bug fix.
     - `docs`: Documentation changes.
     - `refactor`: Code refactoring.

3. **Pull Requests**
   - Keep pull requests small and focused on a single feature or fix.
   - Add a clear description of changes and testing steps.

### **5. Testing**
1. **Unit Testing**
   - Write tests for all critical business logic.
   - Aim for at least 80% test coverage.

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test interactions between modules or services.

3. **Automated Testing**
   - Use CI pipelines to run tests automatically for every pull request.

4. **Testing Frameworks**
   - Specify frameworks and tools (e.g., `pytest` for Python, `Jest` for JavaScript).

### **6. Automation and Tooling**
1. **Linters**
   - Use linters to enforce code style:
     - `ESLint` for JavaScript/TypeScript.
     - `flake8` for Python.
   - Automate linting with pre-commit hooks.

2. **Formatters**
   - Use automatic formatters to maintain code consistency:
     - `Prettier` for JavaScript/TypeScript.
     - `Black` for Python.
     - `go fmt` for Go.

3. **Static Code Analysis**
   - Integrate tools like `SonarQube` or `CodeQL` for identifying vulnerabilities.

### **7. Security Best Practices**
1. **Secrets Management**
   - Store secrets in environment variables or a vault (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
   - Never hardcode secrets in the repository.

2. **Input Validation**
   - Sanitize and validate all user input.

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Use dependency scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities (e.g., `npm audit`, `pip-audit`).

### **8. Performance**
1. Optimize for readability and maintainability first.
2. Use profilers to identify performance bottlenecks.
3. Avoid premature optimization; focus on clarity and correctness.
