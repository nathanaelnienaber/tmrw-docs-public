## Note

While there's no one-size-fits-all for cloud strategies, the *Cloud Platform Operations (CPO)* model caters to varying business requisites, app collections, and cloud evolution stages. The CPO structure emulates an external Managed Service Provider (MSP) with well-defined automation and operational expertise. It may cater to diverse operational requirements through distinct offerings. Typically, the CPO team functions on DevOps agility, collaborating with internal DevOps units, but stands solid even in a non-DevOps environment.
